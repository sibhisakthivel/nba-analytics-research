    "# NBA Player Performance Streak Analysis v2\n",
    "## By Sibhi Sakthivel\n",

    "# Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring “streaks” are one of the most persistent narratives in basketball discourse. Players are frequently described as being “hot” or “cold,” and these labels often influence expectations, analysis, and downstream decisions. In Streak Analysis v1, we evaluated this intuition directly and found that, on average, streak based effects largely disappear once player specific baselines and statistical uncertainty are properly accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "This second iteration expands on that foundation by asking a more nuanced question. Do scoring streaks provide any incremental explanatory value once core game context is considered? Prior analyses, including v1, primarily evaluate streaks in isolation, implicitly averaging over matchup difficulty and game environment. Rather than treating streaks in isolation, this study evaluates them alongside known drivers of performance such as opponent defensive strength and game environment, including home versus away games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodologically, this analysis is framed in an experimentation style structure. A context only model serves as the control, while a context plus streak model serves as the treatment. By comparing these two approaches, we assess whether incorporating streak information meaningfully improves explanatory power, quantify the associated uncertainty, and evaluate whether any observed effects are practically relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is not to establish causal claims about player psychology or momentum. Instead, it aims to demonstrate a rigorous, hypothesis driven approach to statistical analysis, emphasizing baseline construction, uncertainty quantification, regression based inference, and experiment style decision reasoning using NBA performance data as the application domain."

    "# Part 2: Research Question and Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary research question we are going to be addressing in this study is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Do scoring streaks provide incremental explanatory value for next game scoring outcomes once core game context is taken into account?**\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this study evaluates whether incorporating streak based information improves explanatory power beyond a baseline model that accounts for player specific scoring tendencies and fundamental contextual factors such as opponent defensive strength and game environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate this question, the analysis is framed using a control versus treatment comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis:**\n",
    "After controlling for player baselines and game context, scoring streak indicators do not explain additional variation in next game scoring outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis:**\n",
    "After controlling for player baselines and game context, scoring streak indicators explain additional variation in next game scoring outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis framework aligns with an experimentation style evaluation. A context only model serves as the control condition, while a context plus streak model serves as the treatment condition. Evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis would require streak based features to demonstrate statistically detectable effects with practical relevance beyond what is already explained by game context alone."
