# Streak Performance Analysis

This folder contains multiple versions of an NBA streak performance analysis study examining how player scoring behavior changes during extended hot and cold stretches.

The analyses are intentionally versioned to reflect methodological iteration and increasing statistical rigor.

## Structure

- **v1/**  
  Baseline analysis using rolling averages and descriptive comparisons against season-level baselines.  
  Focuses on identifying apparent streak effects in scoring volume and efficiency.

- **v2/**  
  Revised analysis with improved statistical practices and clearer framing.  
  Incorporates stronger baselines, additional controls, and more explicit uncertainty quantification.

Each version is self-contained and includes its own notebooks, source code (where applicable), and output artifacts.

## Motivation

Rather than overwriting prior work, this structure preserves the original analysis while allowing for a clean re-implementation using improved methodology. This mirrors real-world research and analytics workflows, where studies are refined, extended, and re-evaluated over time.
