# NBA Analytics Research

A collection of applied data science studies focused on developing a deeper, evidence-based understanding of NBA player and team performance through **statistical testing, hypothesis-driven analysis, and experimentation-style reasoning**.

This research portfolio is designed to explore common narratives and assumptions in basketball analytics, such as performance streaks, fatigue effects, and contextual advantages, by rigorously evaluating them using statistical methods rather than intuition alone.

Across studies, the emphasis is on:
- defining clear research questions,
- constructing appropriate baselines,
- applying **hypothesis testing and uncertainty quantification**, and
- framing results in an **experiment-like (control vs treatment)** structure to assess whether observed effects are meaningful, stable, and actionable.

While the NBA provides the domain context, the primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate strong statistical reasoning and experimental thinking that generalize to real-world data science and analytics problems.

## Studies

- **Streak Performance Analysis**  
  Investigates whether “hot” and “cold” scoring streaks provide incremental explanatory value beyond player baselines and game context, using hypothesis testing, regression-based inference, and A/B-style feature evaluation.

- **Travel Fatigue & Performance**  
  Examines how schedule density, rest patterns, and travel demands affect team performance, combining exploratory analysis with regression modeling and counterfactual-style reasoning.

- *(More studies forthcoming)*

Each study is self-contained and includes data sourcing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, formal statistical testing, and interpretation of results with explicit attention to uncertainty, limitations, and decision relevance.
